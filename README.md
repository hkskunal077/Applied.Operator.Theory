# Semi-Exponential-Operators
Semi Exponential Operators are special class in Exponential Operators with extra condition on Homogenous Differential Equation of Kernel Function, the research aims to find new class of Semi Exponential Operator based on p(t) analytic function with values different than Baskakov, Post Widder and Szasz Operators.
